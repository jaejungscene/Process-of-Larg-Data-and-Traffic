# Process of Large Data and Traffic
Every project and practice is based on Spring-boot backend environment.  
</br>
As backend developer, I think that it's crucial to develop a server that can endure the large traffic because anyone can make just a simple web and API server. Therefore, this page is a practice place for increasing this ability.

If there's any other problem with the implementation and my concepts, feel free to comment.
